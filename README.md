This template should be used as the starting point for your individual coursework in the module ECS639U Web Programming (at Queen Mary University of London). Module leader: Paulo Oliva <[p.oliva@qmul.ac.uk](mailto:p.oliva@qmul.ac.uk)>

## Create conda environment

After cloning this repository, create a conda environment for this project and activate the environment:

```console
$ conda create --name cwindividual python=3.10
$ conda activate cwindividual
```

## Django backend

The `backend` folder contains a [Django project](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/intro/tutorial01/) and was created with:

```console
(cwindividual)$ django-admin startproject backend
```

### Install backend (Python) dependencies

With the conda environment active, install the backend (Python) dependencies:

```console
(cwindividual)$ cd backend
(cwindividual)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The main backend dependencies (see requirements.txt) are the Django framework itself (Django) and [django-cors-headers](https://pypi.org/project/django-cors-headers/) which is needed for CORS requests (since the request origin address http://localhost:5713 is different from the address that sent the JavaScript code to the browser http://localhost:8000).

### Start backend server

To start the backend server cd into the backend folder where the manage.py file is (if not already there)

```console
(cwindividual)$ cd backend
```

and run

```console
(cwindividual)$ python manage.py runserver
```

The server will start on http://localhost:8000

### API app

An "api" Django app has already been created with the command

```console
$ python manage.py startapp api
```

and can be tested by visiting http://localhost:8000/api/test.json

## Vue frontend

The `frontend` folder contains a [Vue/Vite project](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) and was created with:

```console
(cwindividual)$ npm create vite@latest
```

### Install frontend (JavaScript) dependencies

To install the frontend (JavaScript) dependencies cd into the frontend folder

```console
(cwindividual)$ cd frontend
```

and run:

```console
(cwindividual)$ npm install
```

The main frontend dependencies (see package.json) are [vue](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) and [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/download/).

### Start frontend server

To start the frontend server run

```console
(cwindividual)$ npm run dev
```

and the server will start on http://localhost:5173
